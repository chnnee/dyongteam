Hello! We are team Dyong taking an 'open source SW' lecture at Gachon university. 

In modern cities, movement is essential and traffic is rapidly increasing accordingly.
In response, we created the 'Pedestrain Analysis System on the Road' by utilizing the Github and OpenCV that we learned in the lecture.

Our system focuses on improving traffic safety and efficiency by analyzing the movement of pedestrains on the road in real time.
Furthemore, we can create a better environment by continuously improving road infrastrucure by utilizing the collected pedestrian data.

Our project may be a small effort to explore future road systems and challenge traffic problems in modern cities, but we believe that small efforts can lead to big changes.
Together, we look forward to our efforts to help build a safer and more efficient transportation system in future cities!

Thank you!
